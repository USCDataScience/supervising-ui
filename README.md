# Supervising UI

This project has a web interface to label training data for machine learning task.
As of now it can allow you to easily label images with one or many labels

Support both python 2 and python 3

# Requires

1. flask
2. sqlite3

Install them using pip

# Quick Start

## Step1 : You need to feed training records

`find $HOME -name '*.jpg' > workdir/input.txt `

## Step 2: Create a settings file that contains labels

#### Example :

```
{
  "type": "image-labeling",
  "task": {
  "labels":[[
    "D1",

    "D4",
    "D5",
    "D6"
   ], ["Front",
    "Side",
    "Back"]]
  }
}
```
place this file in a directory with name 'settings.json'
Example : `workdir/settings.json`

## Step 3: Start server

#### Usage

`python app.py -h`

```
usage: app.py [-h] [-i INPUT] -w WORK_DIR [-p PORT]

## WARNING:

+ DO NOT MAKE THIS SERVICE ACCESSIBLE FROM PUBLIC INTERNET.
  _Reason: it also acts as a proxy to serve image files to the web browser, it can be tricked by hackers to download other files from file system. So DO NOT OPEN it to public._ 
  If you are hosting it within your local network in which the service port is not exposed to internet, then it is fine.
